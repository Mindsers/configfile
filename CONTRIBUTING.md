## How to contribute to Ruby on Rails

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues][Issues].

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Mindsers/configfile/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Write new unit test(s) that match the bug case to limit future regression.

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please ensure your code follow the code convention.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails can be accepted:

* Your changes must follow the coding convention.

* Please ensure that your changes does not include regression.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Please ask first ([open an issue][Issues]) before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

* Please adhere to the coding conventions used in this project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Configfile in the [gitter](https://gitter.im/mindsers/configfile) or on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Configfile documentation?**

* Please read [Contributing to the Rails Documentation]().


Thanks!
