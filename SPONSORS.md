## How can I support this project?

*Configfile* is licensed under an Apache-2.0 license, which means that it's a completely free open source software. Unfortunately, *Configfile* doesn't make itself and I'm happy to build it on my free time.

If you're using *Configfile* and want to support the development, you can do it via the Patreon service. On this platform you can choose exactly what you want to give from $1 to whatever you want... You can click on the "Become a patron" button bellow to see Mindsers' patreon page.

Be sure your effort to support this project will be greatly appreciated.
